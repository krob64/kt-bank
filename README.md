### Welcome to our build and learn project "Bank Model".

Goal of this Project is to design and build a *virtual Bank* with several classes in C++. We started from the perspective of one bank branch and thought about a couple of business cases first.
Our virtual Bank has a few ATMs and provides a couple of services and account types: Online banking, credit card, giro card, giro account, credit card account, savings account, day savings account(?)
As we go through the process, we subsequently add programming techniques, that we need to learn in our class provided by Karrieretutor.
Because of this, the comments focus a bit more on learning content rather than on what behaviour is expected as it should be in a proper comment.
We used a couple of resources (some in german), that might be useful to the reader as well. You can find these at the end of this file.

Having said that, here is a list of the programming techniques, that we want to practice (and mark as such) here:

- markup language(done)
- Build an UML Class Diagram (done)

- variadic function parameters argv argc
- virtual keyword usage, abstract class
- overload comparison operators
- dependency injection
- inheritance
- delegation
- Singleton, static
- Yoda principle 
- Create and use own data types, provide type safety.
- Build adapters i.e. using text = std::string
- sort bank customers and return list in alphabetical order using set oder map.
- copy constructors
- rule of 5, rule of 3
- templates
- testing (unit testing, function testing, fixtures etc.)
